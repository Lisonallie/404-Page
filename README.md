### 404-Page

#### What it is ❔❔❔
I was assigned the task to create a 404 page using CSS and HTML. This was an exercise to learn positioning and to get familiar in general in CSS.

#### Objective 🔄🔄🔄
The objective was to learn CSS properties and more about using CSS positioning. I was also asked to create a 'back' button that linked to my GitHub profile. A bonus was to add an animated element.

#### Layout & Look 🖱️🖱️🖱️
  I was very new to positioning in CSS so I was at first over-positioning things and didn't know what I was doing. Near the end of the exercise I received some guidance in what positioning is and how it works, and what flexbox is and how it works. I then tried to implement my new knowledge into this project to have cohesive code.
  On the left I have a sad cloud that scoots left and right like it's raining. On the right I have a very noticeable 404 message. The background is cartoon raindrops. Below the top row of cloud and 404 I have a row including a blue button which links to my GitHub profile. Upon hovering, the button turns pink. Below this button there is a message stating that the page you're looking for doesn't exist.
